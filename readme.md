## 🛠 Built With

- **🖥 HTML5**
- **🎨 Tailwind CSS** - For utility-first styling.
- **🔤 Google Fonts** - Integrated "Outfit" and "Ovo" fonts.
- **💻 JavaScript** - For interactive elements and theme toggling.
- **🖼 Figma** - For design mockups and wireframes.

## 📚 What I Learned

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of **Tailwind CSS** and enhance my skills in **responsive design**. I also implemented a **dark mode feature**, improving user experience across different viewing conditions. The process of creating a fully responsive, multi-page website was particularly rewarding, and I gained valuable experience in using **JavaScript** to manage theme switching dynamically.

## 🔄 Continued Development

In future iterations of this project, I aim to:

- 🏎 Optimize the website for faster load times by implementing **image optimization techniques**.
- 💡 Integrate **server-side rendering (SSR)** for improved SEO and performance.
- ⏳ Implement additional features like a **loading spinner** or **progress bar** during page transitions.
- ⚛️ Explore the possibility of using **React.js** for better component management and scalability.
